# Capstone

## Character Segmentation of cursive handwritten words

Files included in the repo:
  * Capstone.py - runs the program and handles the algorithm selection
  * horizontalHist.py - runs the Horizontal Projection Analysis
  * segmenter.py - handles the running of the segmenter which uses tesseract for determining letters
  * tester.py - runs the tests on all testing words for easily testing with multiple parameters
  * traceTop.py - runs the Top-line Trace
  * vertical.py - runs the Vertical Projection Analysis
  * Images/ - contains all the images for testing
  * Documents/Capstone_presentation.pptx - the capstone presentation slides
  * Documents/Character_Segmentation_of_Cursive_... - the pdf of the research paper
  
Program execution is done by running (will give the usage message for further use):
  * python Capstone.py -h
